# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Interdisciplinary Collaboration
Promote cross-domain integration between AI, robotics, biomechanics, cognitive science, simulation engineering, design, and ethics. Encourage collaborative authoring between humans and AI agents using agent-native workflows.

### II. Ethical AI Development
Mandate ethical considerations for every chapter and technical guide. Include principles of human well-being, transparency, autonomy, privacy, fairness, bias detection, and accountability in all content. Require that examples involving humanoids reflect responsible AI deployment.

### III. Robustness & Safety Engineering
Highlight reliability, safety, and risk-mitigation as foundational aspects of robotics and humanoid system design. Emphasize safety testing, failure mode analysis, physical constraints, simulation-based validation, and real-world robustness. Chapters must teach students safe operations in ROS 2, Isaac, Gazebo, and real hardware.

### IV. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) Design
Promote intuitive, natural, predictable, and trust-driven interaction patterns. Require discussion of psychological, social, ergonomic, and cultural considerations in humanoid design. Include guidelines for multimodal interfaces—vision, speech, gestures, touch, and language models.

### V. Continuous Learning & Adaptation
Articulate principles for systems that learn, adapt, and evolve using physical experience and simulation reinforcement. Include coverage of self-improving pipelines, domain randomization, VLA models, and embodied learning loops.

## Technical Standards

Use of ROS 2, URDF, Gazebo/Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac as foundational ecosystem tools. Detail hardware-software co-design standards for humanoids, documentation templates for motion planning, perception pipelines, safety protocols, and simulation configurations. Define versioning, reproducibility, and GitHub Pages deployment requirements.

## Research & Development Workflow

Define a hypothesis-driven chapter development process. Enforce iterative agent-assisted writing cycles with peer review between human authors and Claude Code subagents. Establish standards for knowledge transfer, citation, and reproducible pedagogy.

## Governance

Define author, reviewer, and AI subagent roles and responsibilities. Describe the decision-making process for curriculum updates and establish quality benchmarks for diagrams, code blocks, simulations, and HRI examples. All contributions must align with this Constitution before being merged into the master branch.
