# Module 2: Content Standards for Physics Concepts

## Core Principles

### Concept-First Approach
- Always introduce the concept before the technical implementation
- Explain "why" before "how"
- Ground physics concepts in physical intuition before mathematical formalism
- Use analogies from everyday experience when possible

### Physics-First, Tool-Second
- Focus on physics concepts before introducing specific tools
- Explain the underlying physics principle before how it's implemented in Gazebo or Unity
- Maintain separation between physics concepts and their simulation implementation
- Emphasize fundamental principles that apply beyond specific tools

## Mathematics Standards

### No Heavy Math Policy
- **Avoid**: Complex equations, calculus, advanced linear algebra
- **Limit**: Basic arithmetic and simple algebraic relationships
- **Focus**: Conceptual understanding over mathematical derivation
- **When Math is Necessary**: Use only the minimum required for clarity

### Acceptable Mathematical Concepts
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)
- Simple ratios and proportions
- Basic geometry (distance, area, volume)
- Basic concepts of rates (speed = distance/time)
- Simple graphs and plots for visualization

### Prohibited Mathematical Concepts
- Derivatives and integrals
- Complex vector mathematics
- Advanced matrix operations
- Differential equations
- Complex statistical methods

## Explanation Standards

### Conceptual Clarity
- Use concrete examples before abstract principles
- Provide multiple explanations for complex concepts
- Use analogies from familiar experiences
- Connect new concepts to previously learned material

### Language Guidelines
- Use active voice whenever possible
- Define technical terms on first use
- Avoid jargon without explanation
- Use consistent terminology throughout

### Visualization Requirements
- Include diagrams to illustrate concepts
- Use step-by-step visual explanations
- Provide real-world examples
- Include conceptual models rather than just technical diagrams

## Simulation-Specific Standards

### Physics Simulation Concepts
- Explain the purpose before the implementation
- Describe the real-world phenomenon being simulated
- Explain why simulation is necessary
- Describe limitations of the simulation approach

### Tool Usage Guidelines
- Focus on conceptual understanding, not UI features
- Explain when to use each tool rather than how to use it
- Describe tool capabilities and limitations
- Maintain focus on physics rather than tool mechanics

## Content Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any content, verify:

### Conceptual Focus

- [ ] Complex concepts are broken into simpler parts
- [ ] Visual aids support the text
- [ ] Connections to previous learning are made

### Accuracy
- [ ] Physics concepts are explained correctly
- [ ] Limitations of simulation are acknowledged
- [ ] No implementation details leak into conceptual explanations
- [ ] Content aligns with module objectives

## Prohibited Content Types

### Strictly Forbidden
- Detailed setup instructions
- Code snippets beyond minimal examples
- Tool-specific UI walkthroughs
- Advanced mathematical derivations
- Implementation-focused content

### Required Avoidance
- "Click here" or "Go to menu" instructions
- Version-specific tool details
- Hardware-specific implementation notes
- Advanced optimization techniques
- Troubleshooting guides

## Quality Assurance

### Review Process
1. Verify conceptual explanation comes before implementation details
2. Check for mathematical complexity and simplify if necessary
3. Ensure real-world connections are clear
4. Confirm terminology consistency
5. Validate that content serves learning objectives

### Validation Questions
- Would someone without advanced math background understand this?
- Does this focus on concepts rather than implementation?
- Are physics principles clearly distinguished from tool features?
- Does this content align with the "why before how" principle?

Following these standards ensures that Module 2 content remains accessible, conceptually grounded, and focused on the fundamental physics principles that govern Physical AI systems.
