# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. In this module, we'll explore the concept of digital twins and how physics-based simulation enables the development of humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of digital twins in Physical AI
- Understand basic physics simulation concepts (gravity, collisions, dynamics)
- Describe how Gazebo simulates robots and environments
- Understand Unity's role in high-fidelity visualization and interaction
- Conceptually understand sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)

### Module Structure

This module consists of four chapters that build upon each other:
1. **Digital Twins and Simulation in Physical AI** - Foundational concepts
2. **Physics Simulation with Gazebo** - Understanding physics simulation
3. **High-Fidelity Environments with Unity** - Visualization and interaction
4. **Simulated Sensors for Humanoid Robots** - Sensor simulation concepts

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed Module 1 and have a solid understanding of:
- ROS 2 fundamentals
- Robot structure and URDF concepts

### Next Steps

This module transitions learners from abstract robot structure (Module 1) to embodied behavior in simulated physical environments, preparing you for Module 3 on perception and AI.
