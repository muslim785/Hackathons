# Module 2: Terminology Standards

This document establishes consistent terminology for simulation concepts used throughout Module 2 to ensure clarity and avoid confusion.

## Core Simulation Terms

**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical robot that enables testing and validation of AI systems in simulated environments before real-world deployment. Always refer to this as a "digital twin" not as "simulation model" or "virtual robot."

**Sim-to-Real Gap**: The differences between robot behavior in simulation and in the real world. Always refer to this as the "sim-to-real gap" not as "simulation error" or "model discrepancy."

**Physical AI**: Artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through robotic embodiment. Always refer to this as "Physical AI" when capitalized, as it's a specific term in our curriculum.

## Physics Simulation Terms

**Rigid Body**: An object that maintains its shape and size regardless of external forces. Always use "rigid body" not "solid object" or "non-deformable object."

**Collision**: The event when two or more objects come into contact with each other. Always use "collision" not "crash" or "impact" in technical contexts.

**Dynamics**: The physics of motion under forces. Always use "dynamics" not "movement" or "motion" when referring to physics simulation.

**Determinism**: The property where identical initial conditions produce identical results. Always use "determinism" not "predictability" or "repeatability."

## Sensor Terms

**LiDAR**: Always write as "LiDAR" (not "lidar" or "LIDAR") when referring to Light Detection and Ranging sensors.

**IMU**: Always write as "IMU" (not "imu" or "I.M.U.") when referring to Inertial Measurement Unit.

**Sensor Noise**: Always refer to this as "sensor noise" not "measurement error" or "data corruption."

## Tool-Specific Terms

**Gazebo**: Always capitalize as "Gazebo" (not "gazebo") when referring to the simulation engine.

**Unity**: Always capitalize as "Unity" (not "unity") when referring to the visualization platform.

## Content Standards

- Use "simulation" as a noun when referring to the practice or field, "simulating" as a verb
- Use "physics simulation" when referring to the simulation of physical phenomena specifically
- Use "robot simulation" when referring to simulating robots specifically
- Use "simulation environment" when referring to the virtual world where simulation occurs
- Use "simulation engine" when referring to the software that performs simulation

## Concepts to Avoid

- Do not use "virtual reality" or "VR" when referring to simulation (unless specifically discussing VR applications)
- Do not use "gaming engine" when referring to simulation engines
- Do not use "rendering" when referring to physics simulation (unless specifically discussing visual rendering)
- Do not use "animation" when referring to physics-based motion
