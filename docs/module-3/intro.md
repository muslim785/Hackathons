# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Introduction to the AI Brain in Physical AI

This module focuses on how intelligence is embedded into robots using NVIDIA Isaac, explaining the core concepts of perception, navigation, and intelligence that operate on top of ROS 2 and simulation environments.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of NVIDIA Isaac in Physical AI systems
- Understand photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Understand hardware-accelerated perception with Isaac ROS
- Explain Visual SLAM (VSLAM) conceptually
- Understand navigation and path planning for humanoid robots

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

### Module Structure

This module consists of four chapters that build on each other to provide a comprehensive understanding of how robots think and perceive:

1. **Chapter 1**: The AI Brain in Physical Robots - Understanding the concept of the AI brain in embodied systems
2. **Chapter 2**: Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data - Exploring photorealistic simulation for AI training
3. **Chapter 3**: Isaac ROS and Accelerated Perception - Learning about hardware-accelerated perception
4. **Chapter 4**: Navigation and Motion Planning (Nav2) - Understanding navigation for humanoid robots

Each chapter is designed to be conceptually complete while building on the previous knowledge.
