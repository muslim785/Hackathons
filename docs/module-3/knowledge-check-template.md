# Knowledge Check Template for Module 3

## Purpose
This template provides a standardized format for knowledge checks throughout Module 3. Each chapter should include knowledge check questions that validate understanding of the core concepts without requiring implementation details.

## Knowledge Check Structure

### Concept Understanding Questions
Questions that test understanding of core concepts introduced in the chapter:

1. **Definition Questions**: "What is [key concept]?"
2. **Purpose Questions**: "Why is [concept] important in robotics?"
3. **Role Questions**: "What role does [component/system] play in [context]?"
4. **Relationship Questions**: "How does [concept A] relate to [concept B]?"

### Application Questions
Questions that test the ability to apply concepts:

1. **Scenario Questions**: "Given [situation], what would [concept] do?"
2. **Comparison Questions**: "How does [approach A] differ from [approach B]?"
3. **Constraint Questions**: "What constraints does [factor] place on [system]?"

### Critical Thinking Questions
Questions that test deeper understanding:

1. **Trade-off Questions**: "What are the advantages and disadvantages of [approach]?"
2. **Limitation Questions**: "What are the limitations of [technology/concept]?"
3. **Integration Questions**: "How does [component] integrate with [other component]?"

## Knowledge Check Format

Each chapter should end with knowledge check questions organized as follows:

### Chapter N: [Chapter Title]

**Concept Understanding:**
1. [Question about core concept]
2. [Question about purpose/role]
3. [Question about relationships between concepts]

**Application:**
4. [Scenario-based question]
5. [Comparison question]
6. [Constraint-related question]

**Critical Thinking:**
7. [Trade-off question]
8. [Limitation question]
9. [Integration question]

## Validation Criteria

Knowledge check questions should:
- Focus on conceptual understanding rather than implementation details
- Be answerable based on chapter content without external references
- Test understanding at multiple cognitive levels
- Avoid questions requiring mathematical calculations
- Reinforce the chapter's learning objectives
