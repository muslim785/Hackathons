# RAG-Ready Content Structure Guidelines

These guidelines ensure all content in Module 4 is optimized for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

## Content Structure Principles

### 1. Semantic Headings
- Use descriptive, specific headings that capture the content's meaning
- Follow a consistent hierarchy (H1 for main sections, H2 for subsections, etc.)
- Make headings self-explanatory without requiring context from surrounding text

### 2. Section Organization
- Each section should be self-contained with complete thoughts
- Limit paragraphs to 3-4 sentences for better retrieval
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for key information
- Include transitional sentences between sections

### 3. Content Chunking
- Organize content in logical, retrievable chunks
- Each chunk should address one specific concept or idea
- Use clear boundaries between different topics
- Maintain context within each chunk

### 4. Metadata and Signposting
- Include clear topic sentences at the beginning of sections
- Use consistent terminology throughout (as defined in terminology.md)
- Add summary sentences at the end of sections when helpful
- Include cross-references to related concepts

### 5. Retrieval-Friendly Formatting
- Use bold for key terms when first introduced
- Include definition lists for important concepts
- Add tables for comparison of concepts when appropriate
- Use consistent formatting for examples and case studies
