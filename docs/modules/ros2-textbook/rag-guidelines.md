# RAG-Friendly Content Structure Guidelines

## Purpose
These guidelines ensure that all educational content in the ROS 2 textbook module is optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, allowing chatbots to accurately answer questions based on the textbook content.

## Guidelines

### 1. Clear Section Headers
- Use descriptive, consistent headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Headers should contain key concepts and terminology
- Avoid ambiguous or colloquial header titles

### 2. Structured Content Format
- Begin each section with a clear topic sentence
- Follow with supporting details and examples
- End with a brief summary or transition sentence
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for complex information

### 3. Terminology Consistency
- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Use the same term consistently throughout the content
- Include a glossary section if needed
- Avoid ambiguous or multiple terms for the same concept

### 4. Self-Contained Information
- Each section should be understandable on its own
- Include necessary context within the section
- Avoid excessive cross-references to other sections
- Make content accessible without external resources

### 5. Fact-Based Statements
- Present information as clear, verifiable facts
- Separate opinions or interpretations from facts
- Use precise language without ambiguity
- Include specific examples with concrete details

### 6. Content Segmentation
- Break long topics into focused subsections
- Each subsection should cover one main concept
- Use consistent formatting across similar content types
- Maintain logical flow between subsections

### 7. Humanoid Robotics Focus
- Include specific examples related to humanoid robots
- Connect abstract concepts to practical applications
- Explain how concepts apply to AI-robot interaction
- Maintain relevance to the target audience (AI developers)
