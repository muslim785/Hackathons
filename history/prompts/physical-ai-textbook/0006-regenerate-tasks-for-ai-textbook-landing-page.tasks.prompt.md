## Prompt

Execute all tasks from the task list to fully build the AI/Spec-Driven Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook with a professional landing page. Generate all content, code, examples, diagrams, simulations, and interactive exercises. Ensure GitHub Pages deployment includes the landing page at `/`, content aligns with Constitution v1.1.0, and optional personalization/translation hooks are included for later implementation.

## Response snapshot

A new `tasks.md` file has been generated at `specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/tasks.md`, incorporating the new "Landing Page Implementation" requirements and other updated details.

## Outcome

- ✅ Updated actionable task list created.
- 🧩 Tasks organized by user story and priority, including landing page.
- 📁 File is ready for the `/sp.implement` command.
- 🔁 Next step: Proceed with `/sp.implement`.

## Evaluation notes
The generated tasks are granular and follow the specified format, ensuring they are ready for an execution agent, now including the landing page.
