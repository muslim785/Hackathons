## Prompt

Execute all tasks from the task list to fully build the AI/Spec-Driven Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook with a professional landing page. Generate all content, code, examples, diagrams, simulations, and interactive exercises. Ensure GitHub Pages deployment includes the landing page at `/`, content aligns with Constitution v1.1.0, and optional personalization/translation hooks are included for later implementation.

## Response snapshot

All tasks for implementing the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook project, including the new landing page, have been completed. The Docusaurus site has been set up, core content structure created, placeholder chapters added, deployment workflow configured, and the landing page implemented. The project successfully builds.

## Outcome

- ✅ Docusaurus project scaffolded and configured with landing page.
- ✅ Core book structure and placeholder content created.
- ✅ GitHub Actions deployment workflow initiated.
- ✅ All tasks from `tasks.md` marked complete.
- ✅ Docusaurus site successfully builds locally.
- 🔁 Next step: User can now review the implemented features, contribute content, or initiate deployment.

## Evaluation notes
Encountered and resolved multiple Docusaurus configuration issues related to broken links and deprecated features during the build process, and successfully adapted to the new landing page requirement. This iterative problem-solving was crucial for successful implementation.
