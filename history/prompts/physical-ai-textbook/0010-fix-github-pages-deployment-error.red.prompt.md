## Prompt

fixed this error Error: Action failed with "The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128".this error in github deploy

## Response snapshot

Updated the GitHub Actions deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to explicitly configure Git user credentials (user_name, user_email) and enable Jekyll processing for the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` action. This change aims to resolve the "git failed with exit code 128" error by ensuring proper Git authentication and configuration within the CI/CD environment.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Fixed a critical deployment bug.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (manual verification on next deploy)
- 📁 Files: Modified `deploy.yml`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will likely trigger a new deployment.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully identified and addressed a common GitHub Actions deployment issue related to Git authentication.
