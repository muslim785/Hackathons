# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Branch**: `001-physical-ai-textbook` | **Date**: 2025-12-06 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the technical implementation for creating the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook. The project will use Docusaurus to build a static website, hosted on GitHub Pages. The content will be written in Markdown, following the structure and principles defined in the project constitution and feature specification. The process will be agent-assisted, using Spec-Kit Plus workflows.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown, JavaScript (Docusaurus v2)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React, Mermaid.js
**Storage**: GitHub Repository
**Testing**: Manual review, automated link checking, and Docusaurus build validation.
**Target Platform**: Web (via GitHub Pages)
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Performance Goals**: Page load times under 2 seconds.
**Constraints**: All content and code must be executable and testable within the Spec-Kit Plus and GitHub Actions environments.
**Scale/Scope**: Approximately 20-30 chapters across 4 modules, plus a capstone project.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Plan enforces collaboration through shared source code and agent-native workflows. (PASS)
- **II. Ethical AI Development**: Plan requires ethical considerations in every chapter. (PASS)
- **III. Robustness & Safety Engineering**: Plan includes safety and reliability as core topics. (PASS)
- **IV. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) Design**: HRI principles will be integrated into relevant chapters. (PASS)
- **V. Continuous Learning & Adaptation**: The subject matter of this principle is central to the book's content. (PASS)
- **Technical Standards**: The plan explicitly adopts the specified technical standards (ROS 2, etc.). (PASS)
- **Research & Development Workflow**: The plan is designed to be executed within this workflow. (PASS)
- **Governance**: The branching strategy and PR process will enforce governance rules. (PASS)

**Structure Decision**: The project will use a standard Docusaurus v2 structure within a `website/` directory to keep it separate from the spec and planning files.
