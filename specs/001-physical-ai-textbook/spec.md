# Feature Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Feature Branch**: `001-physical-ai-textbook`  
**Created**: 2025-12-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Define the full specification for the AI/Spec-Driven textbook project: “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — An Embodied Intelligence Guide”"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Master ROS 2 (Priority: P1)

A student learns the fundamentals of ROS 2 as the central nervous system for a robot, enabling them to build robust and scalable robotic applications.

**Why this priority**: Foundational skill for all subsequent modules.

**Independent Test**: The student can create, build, and run a simple ROS 2 publisher/subscriber system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean ROS 2 workspace, **When** the student follows the tutorial, **Then** they have a functional publisher node sending data.
2. **Given** a functional publisher node, **When** the student creates a subscriber node, **Then** it correctly receives and logs the data.

### User Story 2 - Build a Digital Twin (Priority: P2)

A student creates a simulated version of a robot in Gazebo or Unity, allowing for safe testing and development.

**Why this priority**: Simulation is a critical and safe way to develop and test robotics code before deploying to hardware.

**Independent Test**: The student can launch a simulated robot model in Gazebo and control a joint.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a URDF robot model, **When** the student launches Gazebo, **Then** the robot model appears in the simulated world.
2. **Given** a simulated robot, **When** the student sends a command to a joint, **Then** the corresponding joint moves in the simulation.

### User Story 3 - Integrate an AI Brain (Priority: P3)

A student uses NVIDIA Isaac to add advanced AI capabilities like perception and navigation to their simulated robot.

**Why this priority**: Connects robotics to cutting-edge AI, which is the core theme of the book.

**Independent Test**: The student can run a perception model within Isaac Sim that detects an object.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the simulated environment, **When** an object is placed in front of the robot's camera, **Then** the Isaac perception module correctly identifies and labels the object.

### Edge Cases

- How does the system handle incorrect code provided by the student? (Provide clear, understandable error messages).
- What happens if a simulation environment fails to launch? (Provide troubleshooting steps).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide modular content (chapters, modules, examples, diagrams).
- **FR-002**: System MUST cover Physical AI fundamentals.
- **FR-003**: System MUST teach ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, VLA models, perception, and navigation.
- **FR-004**: System MUST include step-by-step tutorials.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide sample code blocks for ROS2, rclpy, Gazebo, Isaac, and Nav2.
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate diagrams, charts, and architecture visuals.
- **FR-007**: System MUST include a final capstone project guide.
- **FR-008**: System MUST follow all principles of Constitution v1.1.0.

### Key Entities

- **Textbook**: The top-level container for all content.
- **Module**: A collection of chapters focused on a high-level topic (e.g., ROS 2).
- **Chapter**: A detailed lesson with objectives, labs, and notes.
- **Code Example**: A standalone, executable piece of code demonstrating a concept.
- **Diagram**: A visual aid to explain a concept.
- **Glossary**: A collection of defined terms.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of modules are published on a production-ready Docusaurus website.
- **SC-002**: The final capstone project is successfully completed by a test user following the guide, taking no more than 20 hours.
- **SC-003**: All code examples are verified to be executable within the specified Spec-Kit workflows.
