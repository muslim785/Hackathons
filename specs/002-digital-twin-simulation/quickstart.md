# Quickstart Guide: Digital Twin Simulation Module

**Feature**: 002-digital-twin-simulation
**Created**: 2025-12-18

## Prerequisites

- Complete Module 1: Robot Structure and URDF
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Familiarity with robot modeling concepts

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Understanding Digital Twins
- Read Chapter 1 to understand the concept of digital twins in robotics
- Focus on why simulation is essential for Physical AI
- Understand the sim-to-real gap and its implications

### Step 2: Physics Simulation Concepts
- Study Chapter 2 to understand Gazebo's role in ROS 2
- Learn about gravity, collisions, and rigid-body dynamics
- Understand the relationship between URDF models and simulation

### Step 3: Visualization and Interaction
- Explore Chapter 3 to understand Unity's role
- Learn the difference between visual and physical realism
- Understand when to use Unity versus Gazebo

### Step 4: Sensor Simulation
- Complete Chapter 4 to understand simulated sensors
- Learn about LiDAR, camera, and IMU simulation
- Prepare for perception pipeline concepts in Module 3

## Key Concepts to Master

1. **Digital Twin**: Virtual representation enabling testing before real-world deployment
2. **Physics Simulation**: Computational modeling of physical phenomena
3. **Tool Differentiation**: When to use Gazebo vs Unity
4. **Sensor Simulation**: How synthetic data prepares perception pipelines

## Validation Steps

- Complete knowledge checks after each chapter
- Ensure understanding of simulation as a scientific tool (not visualization)
- Verify understanding of sim-to-real gap implications
- Confirm readiness for Module 3 perception concepts

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't treat simulation as a game engine
- Don't introduce perception algorithms prematurely
- Don't focus on tool-specific UI features
- Don't mix up visual realism with physical realism

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll be ready to tackle:
- Module 3: Perception and AI
- Advanced simulation techniques
- Sim-to-real transfer concepts
