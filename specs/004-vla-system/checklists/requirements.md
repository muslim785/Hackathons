# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-20
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Specification focuses on educational content and learning outcomes rather than technical implementation
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Specification clearly defines what learners need to understand and achieve
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Uses clear language appropriate for educational context
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - Includes User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, and Success Criteria

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All requirements are clearly defined without pending clarifications
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each functional requirement can be verified through learner assessment
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - Includes specific metrics like "90% of learners successfully complete"
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Focuses on learning outcomes rather than how content is delivered
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story includes clear Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - Addresses ambiguous commands, LLM failures, and environmental changes
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Clearly defines four chapters with specific learning objectives
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Specifies target audience prerequisites and content standards

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Each requirement specifies what the system must do
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - Addresses the main learning journeys from fundamentals to advanced architecture
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - Clear metrics for learner achievement
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Maintains focus on learning objectives rather than delivery mechanisms

## Notes

- All checklist items have been validated and completed successfully
- Specification is ready for planning phase
