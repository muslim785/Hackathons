# Data Model: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

**Date**: 2025-12-20
**Feature**: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems
**Branch**: 004-vla-system

## Overview

This document defines the conceptual data model for Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook, focusing on Vision-Language-Action systems. Since this is an educational module, the "data model" refers to the conceptual entities and their relationships that students need to understand.

## Core Entities

### 1. VLA System

**Description**: An integrated system connecting vision (perception), language (cognition), and action (physical execution) in embodied robots.

**Key Attributes**:
- Vision component (perception)
- Language component (cognition)
- Action component (execution)
- Physical embodiment constraints
- Real-world interaction capabilities

**Relationships**:
- Contains one or more Voice-to-Action Pipelines
- Contains one Cognitive Planner
- Interfaces with Autonomous Humanoid Architecture

### 2. Voice-to-Action Pipeline

**Description**: A processing chain converting spoken commands to robotic actions through speech recognition, intent mapping, and action sequencing.

**Key Attributes**:
- Speech input interface
- Intent extraction mechanism
- Safety validation layer
- Action sequence output

**Relationships**:
- Part of a VLA System
- Connects to Cognitive Planner for intent processing
- Outputs to Action Execution system

### 3. Cognitive Planner

**Description**: An LLM-based component that translates high-level goals into executable action sequences considering physical constraints.

**Key Attributes**:
- Natural language understanding
- Task decomposition capability
- Physical constraint awareness
- Failure handling mechanisms
- ROS 2 action sequence generation

**Relationships**:
- Part of a VLA System
- Receives intents from Voice-to-Action Pipeline
- Generates action sequences for execution

### 4. Autonomous Humanoid Architecture

**Description**: The complete system design integrating perception → cognition → action flow for independent robot operation.

**Key Attributes**:
- Perception system (sensors, computer vision)
- Cognition system (LLM planning, decision making)
- Action system (motor control, ROS 2 interfaces)
- Integration pathways between components

**Relationships**:
- Contains VLA System as core component
- Interfaces with all other entities

### 5. Intent

**Description**: The interpreted purpose or goal extracted from a natural language command.

**Key Attributes**:
- Command source (voice, text, etc.)
- Action type
- Parameters
- Safety validation status

**Relationships**:
- Generated by Voice-to-Action Pipeline
- Processed by Cognitive Planner

### 6. Action Sequence

**Description**: A series of executable steps generated by the cognitive planner to achieve a specific goal.

**Key Attributes**:
- Sequence of ROS 2 actions
- Execution parameters
- Safety constraints
- Failure recovery steps

**Relationships**:
- Generated by Cognitive Planner
- Executed by Action Execution system

## Relationships Summary

- **VLA System** contains/uses: Voice-to-Action Pipeline, Cognitive Planner, Autonomous Humanoid Architecture
- **Voice-to-Action Pipeline** connects: Speech input → Intent → Cognitive Planner
- **Cognitive Planner** processes: Intent → Action Sequence
- **Autonomous Humanoid Architecture** integrates: All components into complete system

## Validation Rules

1. All intents must pass safety validation before processing
2. Action sequences must respect physical constraints of the robot
3. Cognitive planning must account for real-world execution limitations
4. Voice inputs must be validated for ambiguity before processing

## State Transitions (Conceptual)

1. **Voice Input** → **Intent Extraction** → **Intent Validation** → **Cognitive Planning** → **Action Sequence Generation** → **Execution**

2. **Error/Recovery**: If action fails → Re-planning → New Action Sequence → Execution

## Constraints

1. **Physical Reality**: All plans must account for real-world physics and constraints
2. **Safety First**: Actions must be validated before execution
3. **Embodiment**: Cognitive planning must consider robot's physical form and capabilities
4. **Integration**: All components must work together as a unified system
