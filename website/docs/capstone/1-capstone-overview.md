## Learning Objectives

- Understand the scope and goals of the Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project.
- Identify the key modules and technologies to be integrated.
- Outline the project phases and expected deliverables.

## Project Introduction

The Capstone Project provides an opportunity to integrate and apply all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout this textbook. You will design, simulate, and potentially (depending on available hardware) implement an autonomous humanoid robot system capable of performing a complex task. This project emphasizes embodied intelligence, interdisciplinary collaboration, and responsible AI development.

## Project Goals

-   **Integrate ROS 2**: Utilize ROS 2 for inter-component communication and system orchestration.
-   **Develop Digital Twin**: Create a high-fidelity simulation of a humanoid robot and its environment in Gazebo/Unity.
-   **Implement AI-Robot Brain**: Integrate AI components using NVIDIA Isaac Sim for perception, navigation, or manipulation.
-   **Explore VLA Concepts**: If feasible, incorporate Vision-Language-Action principles for natural interaction or task planning.
-   **Adhere to Principles**: Ensure the project design and implementation strictly follow the ethical, safety, and HRI principles outlined in the project's Constitution.

## Key Technologies to Integrate

-   **ROS 2**: For robotic middleware.
-   **Gazebo/Unity**: For realistic physical simulation.
-   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: For AI model development and advanced simulation.
-   **Python (rclpy)**: For control scripts and AI logic.
-   **URDF**: For robot model description.

## Project Phases

The capstone project will typically follow these phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Planning and Design**: Define the specific task for the humanoid, choose a robot platform (simulated), and outline the system architecture.
2.  **Phase 2: Digital Twin Development**: Assemble/create the humanoid robot model and its environment in a simulator.
3.  **Phase 3: Core Robotics Implementation**: Implement basic control, navigation, or manipulation using ROS 2.
4.  **Phase 4: AI Integration**: Incorporate AI components (e.g., object detection, path planning, voice command interpretation).
5.  **Phase 5: Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test the autonomous behavior in simulation.
6.  **Phase 6: Documentation and Presentation**: Document your design choices, implementation details, and results.

## Expected Deliverables

-   A functional simulated autonomous humanoid system.
-   Well-documented ROS 2 packages and Python scripts.
-   A project report detailing design decisions, implementation, challenges, and results.
-   A video demonstration of the autonomous system's capabilities.

## Safety and Ethics Notes

Given the nature of humanoid robotics, safety is paramount. The project must include thorough risk assessments, and all simulated interactions must prioritize safety. Ethically, consider the societal impact of your humanoid's task, potential biases in AI models, and the responsible use of autonomous systems.

## Summary

The Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project is a culminating experience that challenges you to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical, integrated robotics problem. It emphasizes hands-on development, critical thinking, and adherence to ethical guidelines in building intelligent, physical systems.
