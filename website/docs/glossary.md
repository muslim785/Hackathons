# Glossary

This section provides definitions for key terms used throughout the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook.

## A

**Agent**: An autonomous entity that perceives its environment and acts upon that environment to achieve goals.

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

## B

**Biomechanics**: The study of the mechanical laws relating to the movement or structure of living organisms.

## C

**Cognitive Science**: The interdisciplinary study of mind and intelligence, embracing philosophy, psychology, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, linguistics, and anthropology.

## D

**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical object or system, updated from real-time data, and used for simulation, integration, and testing.

**Docusaurus**: A static-site generator that helps you build documentation websites.

## E

**Embodied Intelligence**: A concept in AI and robotics suggesting that intelligence emerges from the interaction of a body with its environment, rather than solely from abstract computation.

**Ethics**: The moral principles that govern a person's or group's behavior. In AI, this refers to the responsible development and deployment of intelligent systems.

## G

**Gazebo**: An open-source 3D robotics simulator widely used in research and development. It provides the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments.

## H

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The study of interactions between humans and robots, aiming to understand, design, and evaluate robotic systems for human use.

## I

**Isaac Sim (NVIDIA Isaac Sim)**: A scalable robotics simulation platform and synthetic data generation tool that powers the development, testing, and management of AI-based robots.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML file format for describing robots in ROS, used to represent a robot model's kinematic and dynamic properties.

## V

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: Refers to AI models or systems that integrate capabilities for visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action or decision-making.
