## Learning Objectives

- Introduce Gazebo as a primary robotics simulation tool.
- Learn to launch and interact with basic Gazebo environments.
- Understand fundamental Gazebo components like worlds and models.

## Introduction to Gazebo

Gazebo is a powerful 3D robotics simulator widely used in research and development. It provides the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. Gazebo integrates with ROS 2, making it a natural choice for testing ROS-based robot applications.

### Key Features of Gazebo

-   **Physics Engine**: Supports multiple high-performance physics engines (ODE, Bullet, Simbody, DART).
-   **High-Quality Graphics**: Provides realistic rendering for sensors and visualization.
-   **Sensor Models**: Simulate various sensors including cameras, LIDAR, IMUs, and force-torque sensors.
-   **Robot Models**: Supports URDF and SDFormat for describing robots and environments.
-   **Plugins**: Extend Gazebo's functionality with custom plugins.

## Gazebo Components

### Worlds
A "world" in Gazebo defines the environment where robots operate. It includes terrain, objects, light sources, and physics properties. World files are typically in `.world` format (SDFormat XML).

### Models
"Models" represent objects within the Gazebo world, including robots, furniture, and other static or dynamic elements. Robot models are often defined using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and then converted or extended to SDFormat for Gazebo.

## Practical Lab: Launching Your First Gazebo World

*(This section will provide step-by-step instructions on installing Gazebo, launching a simple world (e.g., an empty world or a basic differential drive robot), and using `ros2 run` commands to interact with it.)*

## Safety and Ethics Notes

Accurate simulation of physics and sensor data is crucial for safety. Misrepresenting physical properties in simulation can lead to dangerous real-world behaviors. Always cross-reference simulation results with theoretical models and physical tests.

## Summary

Gazebo serves as an essential tool for robotics simulation, offering a rich environment for testing robot designs and algorithms. By understanding its core components and capabilities, developers can leverage Gazebo to accelerate their physical AI and humanoid robotics projects.
